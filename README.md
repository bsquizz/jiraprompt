COMPLETELY A WORK IN PROGRESS

A CLI-based tool for making agile in jira a little more... simple

This is a project used by the Red Hat CloudForms QE team to make their life easier. It might be useful for you too.

Make sure you have these dependencies installed (e.x., on fedora):

` $ dnf install gcc redhat-rpm-config python2-devel krb5-devel which binutils`

Install with:

` $ pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you have issues with SSL validation, the config supplies a field for the CA trust cert path. You can also comment
out this line to use your system default. On Fedora, you can `dnf install python-requests` to install a patched version
of requests that is already pointed toward the Fedora CA cert bundle by default.
